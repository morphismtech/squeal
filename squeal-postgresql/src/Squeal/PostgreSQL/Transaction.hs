-- | The SQL standard defines four levels of transaction isolation.
-- The most strict is `Serializable`, which is defined by the standard in a paragraph
-- which says that any concurrent execution of a set of `Serializable` transactions is
-- guaranteed to produce the same effect as running them one at a time in some order.
-- The other three levels are defined in terms of phenomena, resulting from interaction
-- between concurrent transactions, which must not occur at each level.
-- The phenomena which are prohibited at various levels are:
--
-- __Dirty read__: A transaction reads data written by a concurrent uncommitted transaction.
--
-- __Nonrepeatable read__: A transaction re-reads data it has previously read and finds that data
-- has been modified by another transaction (that committed since the initial read).
--
-- __Phantom read__: A transaction re-executes a query returning a set of rows that satisfy
-- a search condition and finds that the set of rows satisfying the condition
-- has changed due to another recently-committed transaction.
--
-- __Serialization anomaly__: The result of successfully committing a group of transactions is inconsistent
-- with all possible orderings of running those transactions one at a time.
--
-- In PostgreSQL, you can request any of the four standard transaction
-- isolation levels, but internally only three distinct isolation levels are implemented,
-- i.e. PostgreSQL's `ReadUncommitted` mode behaves like `ReadCommitted`.
-- This is because it is the only sensible way to map the standard isolation levels to
-- PostgreSQL's multiversion concurrency control architecture.
data IsolationLevel

  | ReadCommitted

  -- Nonrepeatable read is possible.
  -- Phantom read is possible. 
  -- Serialization anomaly is possible.

  RepeatableRead -> "REPEATABLE READ"

-- | The transaction access mode determines whether the transaction is `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly`.
-- `ReadWrite` is the default. When a transaction is `ReadOnly`,
-- the following SQL commands are disallowed:
-- @INSERT@, @UPDATE@, @DELETE@, and @COPY FROM@
-- if the table they would write to is not a temporary table;
-- all @CREATE@, @ALTER@, and @DROP@ commands;
-- @COMMENT@, @GRANT@, @REVOKE@, @TRUNCATE@;
-- and @EXPLAIN ANALYZE@ and @EXECUTE@ if the command they would execute is among those listed.
-- This is a high-level notion of `ReadOnly` that does not prevent all writes to disk.

-- | The `Deferrable` transaction property has no effect
-- unless the transaction is also `Serializable` and `ReadOnly`.
-- When all three of these properties are selected for a transaction,
-- the transaction may block when first acquiring its snapshot,
-- after which it is able to run without the normal overhead of a
-- `Serializable` transaction and without any risk of contributing
-- to or being canceled by a serialization failure.
-- This `longRunningMode` is well suited for long-running reports or backups.
