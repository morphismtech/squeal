## introduction

Squeal is a deep embedding of SQL into Haskell. By "deep embedding", I am abusing the
term somewhat. What I mean is that Squeal embeds both SQL terms and SQL types
into Haskell at the term and type levels respectively. This leads to a very high level
of type-safety in Squeal.

Squeal embeds not just the structured query language of SQL but also the
data manipulation language and the data definition language; that's `SELECT`,
`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `WITH`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER` commands.

Squeal expressions closely match their corresponding SQL expressions so that
the SQL they actually generate is completely predictable. They are also highly
composable and cover a large portion of SQL.

## usage

Let's see an example!

First, we need some language extensions because Squeal uses modern GHC
features.

```Haskell
>>> :set -XDataKinds -XDeriveGeneric -XOverloadedLabels -XFlexibleContexts
>>> :set -XOverloadedStrings -XTypeApplications -XTypeOperators -XGADTs
```

We'll need some imports.

```Haskell
>>> import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)
>>> import Data.Int (Int32)
>>> import Data.Text (Text)
>>> import Squeal.PostgreSQL
```

We'll use generics to easily convert between Haskell and PostgreSQL values.

```Haskell
>>> import qualified Generics.SOP as SOP
>>> import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
```

The first step is to define the schema of our database. This is where
we use `DataKinds` and `TypeOperators`.

```Haskell
>>> :{
type UsersColumns =
  '[ "id"   :::   'Def :=> 'NotNull 'PGint4
   , "name" ::: 'NoDef :=> 'NotNull 'PGtext ]
type UsersConstraints = '[ "pk_users" ::: 'PrimaryKey '["id"] ]
type EmailsColumns =
  '[ "id" ::: 'Def :=> 'NotNull 'PGint4
   , "user_id" ::: 'NoDef :=> 'NotNull 'PGint4
   , "email" ::: 'NoDef :=> 'Null 'PGtext ]
type EmailsConstraints =
  '[ "pk_emails"  ::: 'PrimaryKey '["id"]
   , "fk_user_id" ::: 'ForeignKey '["user_id"] "public" "users" '["id"] ]
type Schema =
  '[ "users" ::: 'Table (UsersConstraints :=> UsersColumns)
   , "emails" ::: 'Table (EmailsConstraints :=> EmailsColumns) ]
type DB = Public Schema
:}
```

Notice the use of type operators.

`:::` is used to pair an alias `Symbol` with a `SchemasType`, a `SchemumType`,
a `TableConstraint` or a `ColumnType`. It is intended to connote Haskell's `::`
operator.

`:=>` is used to pair `TableConstraints` with a `ColumnsType`,
yielding a `TableType`, or to pair an `Optionality` with a `NullType`,
yielding a `ColumnType`. It is intended to connote Haskell's `=>` operator

Next, we'll write `Definition`s to set up and tear down the schema. In
Squeal, a `Definition` like `createTable`, `alterTable` or `dropTable`
has two type parameters, corresponding to the schema
before being run and the schema after. We can compose definitions using `>>>`.
Here and in the rest of our commands we make use of overloaded
labels to refer to named tables and columns in our schema.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  setup :: Definition (Public '[]) DB
  setup =
    createTable #users
      ( serial `as` #id :*
        (text & notNullable) `as` #name )
      ( primaryKey #id `as` #pk_users ) >>>
    createTable #emails
      ( serial `as` #id :*
        (int & notNullable) `as` #user_id :*
        (text & nullable) `as` #email )
      ( primaryKey #id `as` #pk_emails :*
        foreignKey #user_id #users #id
          (OnDelete Cascade) (OnUpdate Cascade) `as` #fk_user_id )
:}
```

We can easily see the generated SQL is unsurprising looking.

```Haskell
>>> printSQL setup
```
```SQL
CREATE TABLE "users" ("id" serial, "name" text NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT "pk_users" PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
CREATE TABLE "emails" ("id" serial, "user_id" int NOT NULL, "email" text NULL, CONSTRAINT "pk_emails" PRIMARY KEY ("id"), CONSTRAINT "fk_user_id" FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "users" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE);
```

Notice that `setup` starts with an empty public schema `(Public '[])` and produces `DB`.
In our `createTable` commands we included `TableConstraint`s to define
primary and foreign keys, making them somewhat complex. Our `teardown`
`Definition` is simpler.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  teardown :: Definition DB (Public '[])
  teardown = dropTable #emails >>> dropTable #users
:}

>>> printSQL teardown
```
```SQL
DROP TABLE "emails";
DROP TABLE "users";
```

We'll need a Haskell type for `User`s. We give the type `Generics.SOP.Generic` and
`Generics.SOP.HasDatatypeInfo` instances so that we can encode and decode `User`s.

```Haskell
>>> :set -XDerivingStrategies -XDeriveAnyClass
>>> :{
data User = User { userName :: Text, userEmail :: Maybe Text }
  deriving stock (Show, GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (SOP.Generic, SOP.HasDatatypeInfo)
:}
```

Next, we'll write `Statement`s to insert `User`s into our two tables.
A `Statement` has three type parameters, the schemas it refers to,
input parameters and an output row. When
we insert into the users table, we will need a parameter for the `name`
field but not for the `id` field. Since it's serial, we can use a default
value. However, since the emails table refers to the users table, we will
need to retrieve the user id that the insert generates and insert it into
the emails table. We can do this in a single `Statement` by using a
`with` `manipulation`.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  insertUser :: Statement DB User ()
  insertUser = manipulation $ with (u `as` #u) e
    where
      u = insertInto #users
        (Values_ (Default `as` #id :* Set (param @1) `as` #name))
        OnConflictDoRaise (Returning_ (#id :* param @2 `as` #email))
      e = insertInto_ #emails $ Select
        (Default `as` #id :* Set (#u ! #id) `as` #user_id :* Set (#u ! #email) `as` #email)
        (from (common #u))
:}
```

```Haskell
>>> printSQL insertUser
```
```SQL
WITH "u" AS (INSERT INTO "users" ("id", "name") VALUES (DEFAULT, ($1 :: text)) RETURNING "id" AS "id", ($2 :: text) AS "email") INSERT INTO "emails" ("user_id", "email") SELECT "u"."id", "u"."email" FROM "u" AS "u"
```

Next we write a `Statement` to retrieve users from the database. We're not
interested in the ids here, just the usernames and email addresses. We
need to use an `innerJoin` to get the right result.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  getUsers :: Statement DB () User
  getUsers = query $ select_
    (#u ! #name `as` #userName :* #e ! #email `as` #userEmail)
    ( from (table (#users `as` #u)
      & innerJoin (table (#emails `as` #e))
        (#u ! #id .== #e ! #user_id)) )
:}
```

```Haskell
>>> printSQL getUsers
```
```SQL
SELECT "u"."name" AS "userName", "e"."email" AS "userEmail" FROM "users" AS "u" INNER JOIN "emails" AS "e" ON ("u"."id" = "e"."user_id")
```

Let's create some users to add to the database.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  users :: [User]
  users =
    [ User "Alice" (Just "alice@gmail.com")
    , User "Bob" Nothing
    , User "Carole" (Just "carole@hotmail.com")
    ]
:}
```

Now we can put together all the pieces into a program. The program
connects to the database, sets up the schema, inserts the user data
(using prepared statements as an optimization), queries the user
data and prints it out and finally closes the connection. We can thread
the changing schema information through by using the indexed `PQ` monad
transformer and when the schema doesn't change we can use `Monad` and
`MonadPQ` functionality.

```Haskell
>>> :{
let
  session :: PQ DB DB IO ()
  session = do
    executePrepared_ insertUser users
    usersResult <- execute getUsers
    usersRows <- getRows usersResult
    liftIO $ print usersRows
in
  withConnection "host=localhost port=5432 dbname=exampledb user=postgres password=postgres" $
    define setup
    & pqThen session
    & pqThen (define teardown)
:}
[User {userName = "Alice", userEmail = Just "alice@gmail.com"},User {userName = "Bob", userEmail = Nothing},User {userName = "Carole", userEmail = Just "carole@hotmail.com"}]
```

This should get you up and running with Squeal. Once you're writing more complicated
queries and need a deeper understanding of Squeal's types and how everything
fits together, check out the [Core Concepts Handbook](squeal-core-concepts-handbook.md).
